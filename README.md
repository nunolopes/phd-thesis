Source code (LaTeX) for my PhD thesis.  NUIG template 

## Compiling
To compile the the thesis simply run:
```
pdflatex thesis.tex

Generating the bibliography requires [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/) and run with:
```
biber thesis
```

As usual, you may need to compile multiple times to resolve the cross references.
