\subsection{XSPARQL Semantics for Querying Relational and RDF data}
\label{sec:query-heter-data}

We now define the semantics of \SQLForClause{s} and \SparqlForClause{s} by relying on the evaluation semantics of their
original query languages, namely \ac{SQL} (presented in \cref{sec:sql}) and SPARQL (presented in
\cref{sec:sparql-preliminaries}).
%
The approach we take is to rely on the translation of each language into their respective algebra expressions and
further combine these algebra expressions with any existing XSPARQL variable bindings.
%
Since XSPARQL is based on the semantics of XQuery, variable bindings are stored in the \ecomp{varValue} environment
component of the dynamic environment (\cf~\cref{sec:xquery}), that maps variable names to their value.
%
Next we present how we interpret these variable mappings as a relation and as a solution sequence, thus allowing to
combine the results of \ac{SQL} and SPARQL queries with the existing variable bindings.
