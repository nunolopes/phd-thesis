\chapter{The XSPARQL Language}
\label{cha:xsparql}


This chapter introduces a language that is capable of querying, transforming, and exposing data from heterogeneous
sources, namely sources adhering to the data models presented in \cref{cha:data-models}: the relational model,
the tree-based \ac{XML} and \ac{JSON} formats, and the graph-based \ac{RDF} model.
%
This language, called XSPARQL, is based on the existing standard query languages described in
\cref{cha:query-languages}: \ac{SQL}, XQuery, and SPARQL, that are used to query the heterogeneous input sources.
%
Since \ac{JSON} does not specify a query language XSPARQL, automatically converts \ac{JSON} into a predefined \ac{XML}
representation over which it is possible to use XQuery and XPath (this approach is detailed in \cref{sec:xsparql-json}).
%
XSPARQL consists of an extension of the XQuery language with syntactical constructs from both \ac{SQL} and SPARQL and as
such XSPARQL is an XQuery-flavoured language, whose semantics is defined as an extension of the XQuery
semantics.
%
As a first example we can use this language to expose data in relational databases as \ac{RDF} or \ac{XML} data, in a
similar approach to current proposals for translating relational data to \ac{RDF} (RDB2RDF).  But furthermore a common
language including \ac{SQL}, XQuery and SPARQL can support more involved transformations between different formats, for
instance, enabling the integration of enterprise legacy data into \ac{LOD} as described in \cref{cha:introduction}.
%
The importance of converting data between these data models has been acknowledged within the \ac{W3C} in several
standardisation efforts: \ac{GRDDL}~\cite{Connolly:2007aa}, \ac{SAWSDL}~\cite{FarrellLausen:2007aa}, and more recently
RDB2RDF~\cite{ArenasPrudhommeauxSequeda:2011aa,DasSundaraCyganiak:2011aa}.


In data integration scenarios, such as the one described in \cref{cha:introduction}, we often call the transformations
from the different formats into \ac{RDF}~\emph{lifting} and the transformations in the opposite direction
\emph{lowering}.  The names derive from the fact that \ac{RDF} is classified as having a higher abstraction level when
compared to relational data or even semi-structured \ac{XML} data.

\subsubsection*{Lifting: Transforming Heterogeneous Sources into RDF}
%
Within the \ac{W3C}, the \ac{GRDDL} working group addressed the lifting task by allowing \ac{RDF} data to be extracted
from existing \ac{XML} and (X)HTML Web pages.  The \ac{XML} or \ac{HTML} document can link (by means of a specialised
vocabulary) to \ac{XSLT} transformations that, when applied to the original document, produce the \ac{RDF} data.
%
In the Web Services community, the Web Services Description Language (WSDL)~\cite{ChinniciMoreauRyman:2007aa} is an
\ac{XML}-based language for describing the messages that a web service accepts (sends and receives).  The \ac{SAWSDL}
working group focused on defining mechanisms to add annotations to WSDL documents that allow the \ac{XML} messages of a
web service to be transformed into \ac{RDF} (adhering to a specified schema) and, vice versa, enable the lowering of
data stored in \ac{RDF} and the creation of target \ac{XML} messages.
%
The ongoing RDB2RDF Working Group focuses on transforming data between the relational model and \ac{RDF}, enabling the
vast amounts of data contained in relational databases to be exposed as \ac{RDF}, for example most enterprise data (as
discussed in \cref{cha:introduction}).
%
The RDB2RDF Working Group has defined a mapping vocabulary that specifies how existing relational data can be converted
into \ac{RDF}.  In \cref{sec:examples-rdb2rdf} we will look at how the XSPARQL language implements this
specification.


As described in \cref{sec:rdfxml}, RDF/XML~\cite{BeckettMcBride:2004aa} is the recommended syntax for RDF, using
XML as the underlying representation model and, based on this format, it is conceivable to use \ac{XML}-based tools,
such as \ac{XSLT} or XQuery, to produce \ac{RDF} data.
%
Both the \ac{GRDDL} and \ac{SAWSDL} specifications use \ac{XSLT} to perform lifting and lowering, however, as we will
show, approaches that rely on RDF/XML for transformations between \ac{RDF} and \ac{XML} have several disadvantages.
%
In the following examples we are using XQuery to perform the different transformations, similar transformations can also
be achieved using \ac{XSLT} but this does not invalidate any of the drawbacks we present.
%
\begin{query}[t]
  \lstinputlisting{0-data+queries/lifting-bands.xquery}
  \caption{Lifting using XQuery}
  \label{qr:lifting_xq}
\end{query}
%
\begin{example}[Lifting in XQuery]
  As an example of the lifting transformation, \cref{qr:lifting_xq} presents the XQuery that converts the \ac{XML}
  data from \cref{fig:bands-xml} into \ac{RDF}.
  % 
  This query produces an \ac{RDF} graph similar to the one presented in \cref{fig:bands-rdfxml-abbrev} with the
  exception that it uses blank nodes as idenfiers for all entities, while the graph from \cref{fig:bands-rdfxml-abbrev}
  uses DBpedia \acp{URI} as identifiers.
  % 
  The blank node labels assigned to each entity are generated by using a prefix for each type of entity:
  \textbf{(b)}ands, \textbf{(m)}usic artists, \textbf{(a)}lbums, and \textbf{(s)}ongs, followed by a sequencial
  identifier (\cf~\qname{rdf}{nodeID} in \cref{nodeid}).
  %
  Having determined all the identifiers (in \crefrange{pos-start}{pos-end}), the query produces the required RDF/XML
  structure: the triples refering to bands, their name and its members are generated in
  \crefrange{bands-start}{bands-end}.
  %
  A similar process is then repeated for artists (\crefrange{artists-start}{artists-end}), albums
  (\crefrange{albums-start}{albums-end}), and songs (\crefrange{songs-start}{songs-end}).
  % 
\end{example}
% 
While this example presents a valid solution for lifting, we can observe the following drawbacks:
%
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item we have to build RDF/XML manually and cannot use the more readable and concise Turtle syntax; and
\item the resulting \ac{RDF} data is not  guaranteed to be valid (according to \cref{def:rdf-triple}).
\end{itemize}
%
The task of lifting data from relational databases can be performed in a similar fashion by relying on
SQL/XML~\cite{EisenbergMelton:2001aa} however this would introduce an indirection step by first having to transform data
into \ac{XML} and then into \ac{RDF}.
%
Combining \ac{SQL}, XQuery, and SPARQL in XSPARQL simplifies the lifting process, allowing to use SPARQL
\ConstructClause{s} to generate \ac{RDF} in Turtle format (directly from relational data or \ac{XML}) and performing
automatic validation of the generated \ac{RDF}.

We next present the syntax and semantics of the XSPARQL language in \cref{sec:syntax,sec:semantics}, respectively.  We
continue by presenting properties relating the novel language with its constituent languages
(\cref{sec:correspondence}), introduce our handling of \ac{JSON} data in \cref{sec:xsparql-json}, and presenting the
processing of RDB2RDF mappings within XSPARQL (\cref{sec:examples-rdb2rdf}).
%
Finally, we introduce a discussion on related works in \cref{sec:relworks}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:xsparql-conclusions}

This chapter described the novel query language that we defined to tackle the integration of heterogeneous sources.  We
presented the syntax and semantics of the language, which are based on the syntax and semantics of the XQuery language.
% 
XSPARQL relies on the semantics of the other languages, \ac{SQL} and SPARQL for querying the relational and \ac{RDF}
data and we also presented equivalences between the execution of queries in the different languages.

This query language forms the basis for a possible solution for the presented data integration scenario.
%
In the next chapter we present our implementation of XSPARQL and tackle the problem of defining optimisations for the
XSPARQL language, in an attempt to lower the query evaluation times for more complex queries, while the issue of
representing meta-information in \ac{RDF} is addressed in \cref{cha:anql}.
